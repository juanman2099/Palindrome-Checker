# Palindrome Checker
A web tool that checks if a word or phrase reads the same backwards and forwards. Built with JavaScript logic that ignores punctuation, spaces, and case, so the focus stays on the palindrome magic.

- radar  
- level  
- was it a car or a cat i saw  
- a man, a plan, a canal, Panama
